            <description><![CDATA[<p>A little about me.  I grew up in the suburbs of Værløse, graduated from STX Borupgaard in 2009, worked as a bike messenger and subsequently as a daycare assistant before I discovered my love for graphic design and then enrolled at KTS to become a graphic designer where I graduated with 12 (A ects). I am an easygoing, calm & outgoing guy who smiles a lot (or so I've heard). I love all things pop culture. Movies, Music, Gaming, Comic Books, Manga.. you name it. I play Basketball, and enjoy socialising over beers as much as the next person. I mean who doesn’t. I have an insatiable appetite for what’s trending in the design world and check sites as Medium, Bechance, Dribble, Grafik, daily.  </p>]]></description>
