  A little about me. I grew up in the suburbs of Værløse, graduated from STX
  Borupgaard in 2009, worked as a bike messenger and subsequently as a daycare
  assistant before I discovered my love for graphic design and then enrolled at
  KTS to become a graphic designer where I graduated with 12 (A ects). I am an
  easygoing, calm & outgoing guy who smiles a lot (or so I've heard). I love all
  things pop culture. Movies, Music, Gaming, Comic Books, Manga.. you name it. I
  play Basketball, and enjoy socialising over beers as much as the next person.
  I mean who doesn’t. I have an insatiable appetite for what’s trending in the
  design world and check sites as Medium, Bechance, Dribble, Grafik, daily.
